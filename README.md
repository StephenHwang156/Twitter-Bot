# Twitter-Bot
This Twitter Bot is a Python script that scrapes images from a website (ifunny.co in my case) 
and posts them onto a Twitter account using a Twitter Application at a set interval.

# Usage
The user must create their own config.py file containing the keys and details of their own
Twitter app. Also, the Tweepy, BeautifulSoup, and requests libraries must be installed. After,
run wrapper.py with config.py in the same folder.
